				What is this?

					Actually, this is a simple timer.<br>
					With some neat features.<br>
					And these features help you to boost your productivity.<br>
					(At least they have improved mine)
				</p>
				<p>
					A lot of blog posts recommend to work for <br>
					a specific amount of time, then relax a little bit:<br>
					45 minutes work. 30 minutes rest.<br>
					48 minutes work. 12 minutes rest.<br>
					90 minutes work. 30 minutes rest.<br>
					...
				</p>
				<h2>
					And now?
				</h2>
				<p>Now, you can specify three things:</p>
				<ul>

				</ul>
				<p>
					First: The time you want to work.<br>
					Second: The time you want to relax.<br>
					Third: How often you want to repeat this cycle.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the work interval, focus on your work.<br>
					During the relax interval, distract yourself from work.<br>
					And do this as often as you want.
					That's it.
